#### Household (Capstone Project for Nashville Software School)

### Description

This is a capstone for Nashville Software School that will comprise of both backend and frontend. It is similar to my front end capstone in ways that its a react task app where tasks can be completed by users but its different in other respects. In implentation, it uses .NET Core API and SQL Server instead of Firebase. For react, I will be using hooks api in most cases instead of class components, and will use async/await instead of promises. In business logic, smooches inc uses a checkout and "store of services", while "Household" goes a different path and makes a way for a user to share images and details on *how to organize*; thus its a *reference for the way chores should be done* first and foremost, and its second function is to provide a way to complete them. Checkboxes are only helpful if the task was done and done correctly, but this allows people in a household to get at least 1% better by providing a means to measure their own adherence to the task demand. Another benefit is that it allows one not to concentrate on all of the tasks, but only the ones assigned to them, and finally to be able to see what percentage of the weekly tasks they are done with compared to others in the household. 

#### Need

Pinterest allows for users to show their ideas, and has served as a way to curate and *work on themselves* via what they aspire their boards to be.

Most people *don't live in houses that are on display* regularly, and *often put things away in the wrong place*.

People whose living spaces don't match Marie Kondo or Martha Stewart may still need a way to show others (if just people in their own household) or to remember themselves, how they prefer to keep things organized. This need personalizes and makes it less *influencer*, and more simply being just a good citizen of the house. 

That's where Household comes in. Household addresses the need families have to show each other how things should be organized.
